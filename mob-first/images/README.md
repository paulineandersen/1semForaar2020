# Photos: Mobile first

How would you edit these pictures in Photoshop or similar?

* Optimize for mobile first.
* Crop, resize?
* Resolution?

Use at least one of these images as a background in the header. Manipulate them as you like in Photoshop. First of all: create versions for mobile devices.

Create at least:

* a texture
* an image for display on a mobile site

Don't overwrite the original images. They may come in handy later on.
